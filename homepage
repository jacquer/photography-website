  I picked this image as when I first came to Canada I lived in Calgary, AB, and spent many days in the mountains exploring. There was a particularly memorable day at Lake Louise where we took a wrong turn and ended up hiking 30km instead of 12! This was our view walking back to the car, and despite being in a lot of pain lol I couldn't help but appreciate the calming, quintessential beauty of 'The Canadian Dream' - paddling around in a red canoe on a glacier-fed, bright blue lake.

        When asked if I am pessimistic or optimistic about the future, my answer is always the same: If you look at the science about what is happening on earth and aren’t pessimistic, you don’t understand the data. But if you meet the people who are working to restore this earth and the lives of the poor, and you aren’t optimistic, you haven’t got a pulse.

My favourite is my Rhaphidophora Tetrasperma (commonly known as Mini Monstera), as it is just so cute lol.
